# Text-Similarity-Analyzer

### Overview
The Text Similarity Analyzer is a tool designed to compare the contents of two text files to identify potential plagiarism. By using the difflib library's SequenceMatcher class, the tool calculates a similarity ratio between the two texts, indicating the percentage of content that is similar or identical.

### Features

Prepare two text files (sample1.txt and sample2.txt) that you want to compare.

Place the text files in the same directory as the script.
